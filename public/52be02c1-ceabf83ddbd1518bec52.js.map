It's a sophisticated, creative use\r\n            of language to convey meaning and mood. It's an important tool in the writer's toolbox. </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Hyperbole</strong> uses extreme exaggeration and is not meant to be taken\r\n            literally. Examples: I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. I could have died of embarrassment.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Idioms</strong> are figures of speech that cannot be understood from a\r\n            literal\r\n            understanding of the words\r\n            alone. Examples: The cat is out of the bag. Stop beating around the bush. <br/>Someone visiting from\r\n            another country would not understand these phrases without someone explaining the meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Similes </strong>make comparisons between two unrelated elements by using\r\n            'like' or 'as' to highlight a\r\n            common quality both things share. Examples: Her eyes shone like diamonds. He was as strong as a horse.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Metaphors</strong> make comparisons between two unrelated things by\r\n            stating one thing <i>is</i> the other thing. Example: Life is a rollercoaster.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Oxymorons </strong>combine two opposing elements into a single phrase to be\r\n            thought\r\n            provoking or funny.\r\n            Example: Deafening silence. A known secret.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Personification</strong> is a metaphor where human actions, feelings or\r\n            traits are given to a non-human. Examples: Books were her constant companions. That car's a beauty. An angry\r\n            sky.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Alliteration </strong>is the repetition of the same letter sound across the\r\n            start\r\n            of several words in a\r\n            line of text. The word comes from the Latin \"littera,\" meaning \"letter of the alphabet\". Example: The\r\n            slithering snake slid sideways silently. </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Assonance </strong>is the repetition of vowel <i>sounds</i> within a group\r\n            of\r\n            words. Example: Fleet feet\r\n            sweep by sleeping geese. Dr. Suess often used alliteration and assonance in his books: Through three\r\n            cheese trees three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew. </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Allusion </strong>is an <i>implied </i>reference to a person, event, or thing\r\n            based on the\r\n            assumption that you\r\n            know what the person is talking about. The author assumes the reader will understand the reference.\r\n            Example: <i> You're acting like such a Scrooge! </i>This assumes the reader is familiar with the Scrooge\r\n            character from Dickens's A Christmas Carol. This means that the person is being selfish, like the\r\n            character from the story.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">State which type of figurative language is used in each example below:<br/>\r\n            1. \"Her face is like a sunbeam.\" <br/>\r\n            2. \"The tropical storm slept for two days.\" <br/>\r\n            3. \"I had so much homework, I needed a pickup truck to carry all my books home!\" <br/>\r\n            4. What is a literary technique in which two contradictory words come together for a special effect? For\r\n            example, <i>original copy</i> or <i>jumbo shrimp</i>?<br/>\r\n            5. \"Let us go forth and lead the land we love\" contains an example of what type of figurative\r\n            language?<br/>\r\n            6. \"We real cool. We Left school. We Lurk late. We Strike straight. We Sing sin. We Thin gin. We Jazz\r\n            June. We Die soon.\" In this poem by Gwendolyn Brooks, what poetic device is used?</p>\r\n          <p>\r\n            <ol className=\"vocab\">Give an example for each of the following. <br/>\r\n              <li>Hyperbole</li>\r\n              <li>Idiom</li>\r\n              <li>Simile</li>\r\n              <li>Metaphor</li>\r\n              <li>Oxymorons</li>\r\n              <li>Personification</li>\r\n              <li>Alliteration</li>\r\n              <li>Assonance</li>\r\n              <li>Allusion</li>\r\n            </ol>\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <textarea className=\"textArea\"\r\n                    placeholder=\"Copy/paste questions into this textbox and then write your answers here.

At the start of his journey, when Santiago asks a gypsy woman to interpret his dream about a\r\n            treasure in the Egyptian pyramids, she asks for one tenth of the treasure in return. When Santiago asks\r\n            the old man to show him the path to the treasure, the old man requests one tenth of his flock as\r\n            \"payment.\" Both payments represent a different price we have to pay to fulfill a dream; however, only\r\n            one will yield a true result. Which payment represents false hope? Can you think of examples from your\r\n            own life when you had to give up something to meet a goal and found the price too high? <br/>\r\n\r\n            2. Paulo Coelho once said that alchemy is all about pursuing our spiritual quest in the physical world\r\n            as it was given to us. It is the art of transmuting the reality into something sacred, of mixing the\r\n            sacred and the profane. With this in mind, can you define your Personal Legend? At what time in your\r\n            life were you first able to act on it? What was your \"beginner's luck\"? Did anything prevent you from\r\n            following it to conclusion? Having read The Alchemist, do you know what inner resources you need to\r\n            continue the journey? <br/>\r\n\r\n            3. One of the first major diversions from Santiago's journey was the theft of his money in Tangiers,\r\n            which forced him into taking a menial job with the crystal merchant. There, Santiago learned many\r\n            lessons on everything from the art of business to the art of patience. Of all these, which lessons were\r\n            the most crucial to the pursuit of his Personal Legend? <br/>\r\n\r\n            4. When he talked about the pilgrimage to Mecca, the crystal merchant argued that having a dream is more\r\n            important than fulfilling it, which is what Santiago was trying to do. Do you agree with Santiago's\r\n            rationale or crystal merchant's? <br/>\r\n\r\n            5. The Englishman, whom Santiago meets when he joins the caravan to the Egyptian pyramids, is searching\r\n            for \"a universal language, understood by everybody.\" What is that language? According to the Englishman,\r\n            what are the parallels between reading and alchemy? How does the Englishman's search for the alchemist\r\n            compares to Santiago's search for a treasure? How did the Englishman and Santiago feel about each\r\n            other? <br/>\r\n\r\n            6. The alchemist tells Santiago \"you don't have to understand the desert: all you have to do is\r\n            contemplate a simple grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation.\" With this in\r\n            mind, why do you think the alchemist chose to befriend Santiago, though he knew that the Englishman was\r\n            the one looking for him? What is the meaning of two dead hawks and the falcon in the oasis? At one point\r\n            the alchemist explains to Santiago the secret of successfully turning metal into gold. How does this\r\n            process compare to finding a Personal Legend? <br/>\r\n            7. At the very end, why did the alchemist leave Santiago alone to complete the journey? <br/>\r\n            8. Earlier in the story, the alchemist told Santiago \"when you possess great treasures within you, and\r\n            try to tell others of them, seldom are you believed.\" At the end of the story, how did this simple\r\n            lesson save Santiago's life? How did it lead him back to the treasure he was looking for? <br/></p>\r\n\r\n          <textarea className=\"textArea\"\r\n                    placeholder=\"Copy/paste questions into this textbox and then write your answers here.

Do you believe every person has a personal legend they must pursue? If so, what is yours? If not, Why\r\n            do you believe this?<br/>\r\n            4. Coelho states that \"simple things are the most valuable and only wise people appreciate them.\"\r\n            Produce a written or artistic response which depicts something that is \"simple\" yet valuable to you and\r\n            explain why it is so important. <br/>\r\n            5. The alchemist (in the form of Melchizedek) says to Santiago, \"When you really want something to\r\n            happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true.\" Write or create a response which\r\n            captures a time in your own life when you had a wish, and you felt that the whole universe conspired for\r\n            OR against you. What happened to make you feel that way? Did your wish come true? <br/>\r\n            6. The old man states that the \"world's greatest lie….is that at a certain point in our lives, we lose\r\n            control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate.\" Do you, like the old man,\r\n            believe this is a lie, and that we are always in control of our destinies? Why/ why not? Why do you\r\n            think people believe the \"World's greatest lie\"? Or…..Write about/explore artistically a time in your\r\n            life when you felt as though you had \"lost control,\" and your fate was being determined by other forces.\r\n            Why did you feel that way? Did you regain control? <br/>\r\n            7. Santiago is told that \"people are afraid to pursue their most important dreams because they feel they\r\n            don't deserve them, or that they'll be unable to achieve them.\" Create a written or artistic response to\r\n            the following: Do you have a goal or dream which intimidates you? Why do you feel unworthy or fearful of\r\n            it? What practical steps might you take to make the goal more accessible or easier to accomplish? On the\r\n            other hand, are there some dreams which we are correct to fear? Do you believe some dreams should simply\r\n            remain as dreams? Why/why not? <br/>\r\n          </p>\r\n          <textarea className=\"textArea\"\r\n                    placeholder=\"Copy/paste questions into this textbox and then write your answers here.

What word choices does the narrator use to try to convince the reader that he is being\r\n            cheerful about the subject of death? Is the narrator able to fully present death as a cheerful topic?\r\n            Why or why not? <br/>\r\n            8. Death, the narrator, finds his duties painful.

Why or\r\n            why not?<br/>\r\n            11. Whose death does Death describe first in the novel?<br/>\r\n            <i> The Eclipse </i> <br/>\r\n            12. In addition to describing the pilot's death, what does Death describe for the reader?<br/>\r\n            13.

What image does Death paint for the reader when he sees <i> The Book Thief</i> the third time? How\r\n            does Death \"feel\" about the image of Liesel? Why does Death not comfort the child? What does this\r\n            imply about Death's ultimate power?<br/>\r\n            16. Why does Death take the item from the garbage truck?<br/>\r\n            17. Identify the three colors associated with <i> The Book Thief</i>. What clue to the novel's\r\n            historical context does the reader first get from \"the colors\"? For a hint, look up the German Nazi\r\n            flag during WWII. <br/>\r\n            18. Death says, \"First the colours. Then the humans. That's how I usually see things.\" Death describes\r\n            the way he sees colors: \"A single hour can consist of thousands of different colours. Waxy yellows,\r\n            cold-spat blues.

In the opening of the book when Liesel steals her first book, <i>The Gravedigger's Handbook,</i> this\r\n            event\r\n            can be thought of as the first of many turning points for her. What are some of the others? Talk about\r\n            two other major characters and what their turning points are.<br/>\r\n            3. Knowing that Liesel is called a \"thief,\" how does the book complicate our ideas of justice and\r\n            judgment? Which characters do you view as just/unjust or brave/cowardly, and why? Which events or\r\n            details most influence your perceptions of these characters?<br/>\r\n            4. What choices do characters make about groups they will belong to? What groups do they belong to\r\n            without choice? What are the consequences?<br/>\r\n            5. Discuss Liesel's friendship with Rudy. Does she love him in the way he loves her, or is it a\r\n            child's love? Do you think he reminds her of her brother?<br/>\r\n            6. Zusak's books often portray characters with a tendency to fight—including Max and Liesel. Is a\r\n            child who fights more forgivable that an adult who fights? Why?<br/>\r\n            7. From Hans to Liesel to the mayor's wife, discuss how some of the characters in <i> The Book\r\n              Thief</i> deal with their past. Discuss the pasts of each of these three characters and how they\r\n            manage guilt and punishment. <br/>\r\n            8. Is Hans Hubermann a courageous man? How does he show courage, or lack of courage?<br/>\r\n            9. Name some acts of resistance in the book, from large to small. What does the author intend with his\r\n            inclusion of these acts?<br/>\r\n            10. Who has power in this book? How does Liesel gain power, and how does Max? Toward the end of the\r\n            novel Liesel remarks to herself that words give power. How so?<br/>\r\n            11. What is the meaning behind Max painting over Mein Kampf?

Using \"I\" is first person. Using\r\n            \"you\" is second person. Third person uses he or she. The third-person omniscient point of view tells the\r\n            thoughts and feelings of all the characters. </p>\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">PLOT: What happens in the story? What are the sequence of events? </p>\r\n          <p>SETTING: Where and when is it (past, present or future)? </p>\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">CONFLICT: What is the challenge the main character must face in order to grow and\r\n            change? What obstacles must be overcome? Most stories contain several small conflicts and one large or\r\n            major conflict. </p>\r\n          <p>RESOLUTION: How does the problem get solved? </p>\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">CHARACTERS: Who is in your story? Who is the main character (protagonist)? Who\r\n            are the supporting characters? </p>\r\n          <p><strong>Developing your characters</strong> is important because your readers must\r\n            care about what\r\n            happens to them. They don’t have to be likable, but they must be credible. Your readers should be feel\r\n            the characters are real and be able to picture them clearly in their heads. You should describe what they\r\n            look like and their personality. </p>\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">Include character traits (ex. humor, wit, introversion), strengths (ex.\r\n            intelligence, stamina, humor) and flaws (ex. short-temper, physical disability). The main character\r\n            (protagonist) is the most important because the story tends to revolve around them. They determine the\r\n            way the plot will develop and must solve a problem or solve a mystery. </p>\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">Supporting characters are also important because they often help the main\r\n            character or serve as their enemy, creating obstacles. It’s your job to get the readers to feel\r\n            something for all of your characters; like them, hate them, root for them, feel devastated when they are\r\n            harmed and happy when they triumph.</p>\r\n          <p style={{ paddingBottom: \"1.8em\" }}>You can print out the <a\r\n            href={require(\"../resources/languagearts/StoryOutlineWorksheet.pdf\")} rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Story\r\n            Outline Worksheet</a> to help you get started on a rough draft for your stories.
