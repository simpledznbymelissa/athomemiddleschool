For example, Saint-Exupéry searched for the meaning of life, he was a pilot who crashed in\r\n            the desert and the rose is said to be his wife, Consuelo.</p>\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">In your essay, you must explain how the examples you select from the fable symbolize\r\n            things or people in\r\n            Saint-Exupéry’s life. It’s not enough to state that the rose was his wife. You must explain how you know\r\n            this\r\n            by referring to specific passages in the novel and the articles posted below.

It's a\r\n            sophisticated, creative use\r\n            of language to convey meaning and mood. It's an important tool in the writer's toolbox. </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Hyperbole</strong> uses extreme exaggeration and is not meant to be taken\r\n            literally. Examples: I'm so hungry I could eat a horse. I could have died of embarrassment.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Idioms</strong> are figures of speech that cannot be understood from a\r\n            literal\r\n            understanding of the words\r\n            alone. Examples: The cat is out of the bag. Stop beating around the bush. <br/>Someone visiting from\r\n            another country would not understand these phrases without someone explaining the meaning.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Similes </strong>make comparisons between two unrelated elements by using\r\n            'like' or 'as' to highlight a\r\n            common quality both things share. Examples: Her eyes shone like diamonds. He was as strong as a horse.\r\n          </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">A <strong>metaphor</strong> makes a comparison between two unrelated things by\r\n            stating one thing is the other thing. Example: Life is a rollercoaster.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Oxymorons </strong>combine two opposing elements into a single phrase to be\r\n            thought provoking or funny. Example: Deafening silence. A known secret.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Personification</strong> is a metaphor where human actions, feelings or\r\n            traits are given to a non-human. Examples: Books were her constant companions. That car's a beauty. An angry\r\n            sky.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Alliteration </strong>is the repetition of the same letter sound across the\r\n            start of several words in a line of text. The word comes from the Latin \"littera,\" meaning \"letter of the\r\n            alphabet\". Example: The\r\n            slithering snake slid sideways silently. </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\"><strong>Assonance </strong>is the repetition of vowel <i>sounds</i> within a group of\r\n            words. Example: Fleet feet\r\n            sweep by sleeping geese. Dr. Suess often used alliteration and assonance in his books: Through three\r\n            cheese trees three free fleas flew. While these fleas flew, freezy breeze blew. </p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">Allusion is an <i>implied </i>reference to a person, event, or thing based on the\r\n            assumption that you\r\n            know what the person is talking about. The author assumes the reader will understand the reference.\r\n            Example: <i> You're acting like such a Scrooge! </i>This assumes the reader is familiar with the Scrooge\r\n            character from Dickens's A Christmas Carol. This means that the person is being selfish, like the\r\n            character from the story.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p className=\"topBottom\">State which type of figurative language is used in each example below:<br/>\r\n            1. \"Her face is like a sunbeam.\" <br/>\r\n            2. \"The tropical storm slept for two days.\" <br/>\r\n            3. \"I had so much homework, I needed a pickup truck to carry all my books home!\" <br/>\r\n            4. What is a literary technique in which two contradictory words come together for a special effect? For\r\n            example, <i>original copy</i> or <i>jumbo shrimp</i>?<br/>\r\n            5. \"Let us go forth and lead the land we love\" contains an example of what type of figurative\r\n            language?<br/>\r\n            6. \"We real cool. We Left school. We Lurk late. We Strike straight. We Sing sin. We Thin gin. We Jazz\r\n            June.

Poets themselves have struggled with this\r\n            question, often using metaphors to approximate a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An\r\n            echo? A dream? </p>\r\n          <p> What makes a poem a poem is its ability to make the reader feel something. It may rhyme, but doesn’t have\r\n            to. Using few words, it creates a picture in the reader's mind and transports them to another place and\r\n            time. </p>\r\n          <Video videoUrl=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JwhouCNq-Fc\"/>\r\n          <p className=\"margin-para\">\r\n            <ol className=\"vocab\">\r\n              <li> What are characteristics traditionally associated with poetry?</li>\r\n              <li> In what way was Joanna Smith’s tweet like a poem?</li>\r\n              <li> The word poetry comes from the Greek \"poiesis.\" What does this word mean?</li>\r\n              <li> What is a haiku?</li>\r\n              <li> What does Reinhard Dohl’s \"Apfel\" have in common with e.e. cummings’ \"l(a)\"?</li>\r\n              <li> What does the Dartmouth study mentioned in the video suggest about the nature of poetry?

Watch the video below and then answer the questions about Apollinaire.</p>\r\n          <Video videoUrl=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJ0x1YOuMwQ\"/>\r\n          <h4> Ocean of Earth </h4>\r\n          <ul style={{ color: \"#7c7f93\" }}>\r\n            <li>by GUILLAUME APOLLINAIRE</li>\r\n            <li className=\"poem\">I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean</li>\r\n            <li>Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes</li>\r\n            <li>Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are</li>\r\n            <li>Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes</li>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>House of dampness</li>\r\n            <li>House of burning</li>\r\n            <li>Season’s fastness</li>\r\n            <li>Season singing</li>\r\n            <li>The airplanes are laying eggs</li>\r\n            <li>Watch out for the dropping of the anchor</li>\r\n            <br/>\r\n            <li>Watch out for the shooting black ichor</li>\r\n            <li>It would be good if you were to come from the sky</li>\r\n            <li>The sky’s honeysuckle is climbing</li>\r\n            <li>The earthly octopi are throbbing</li>\r\n            <li>And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers</li>\r\n            <li>Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks</li>\r\n            <li>Around the house is this ocean that you know well</li>\r\n            <li> And is never still</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <br/>\r\n          <ol className=\"vocab\">QUESTIONS<br/>\r\n            <li className=\"poem\"><i>Based on the video:</i> Which new form of liberty does Apollinaire experiment\r\n              with in his poetry?\r\n            </li>\r\n            <li> Which parts of the poem \"Lettre Océan\" could best be described as traditional poetry?

What do the boys do to disguise themselves? Why is Pony so reluctant to do anything<br/>\r\n            with his hair?<br/>\r\n            4. Johnny states that when people go to jail, the authorities cut their hair to \"break\" them.\r\n            Why would he think this? What does this say about his opinion of authority? Why is hair\r\n            really cut when people are sent to jail?<br/>\r\n            5. How did the boys show their feelings as emotion overcame them? Do you think their\r\n            behavior was \"in character\" or did it deviate from the image the writer was trying to\r\n            create? Explain.<br/>\r\n            6. Read the following quote, which took place after the boys cried. \"...for the first time since\r\n            Dally and I had sat down behind those girls at the Nightly Double, I relaxed.

Ponyboy realizes he likes Soda, Two-Bit, and Darry’s qualities that are like heroes in\r\n            novels, while Johnny likes Dally because he is \"real.\" What does this mean? Why would\r\n            Ponyboy relate more to people who portray the characteristics of a character in a novel,\r\n            while Johnny is enamored with characters who are realistic?<br/>\r\n            9. Why does Ponyboy get sick on the fifth day at the church?<br/>\r\n            10. What does Dally bring to Ponyboy from Sodapop?

Dally tells Johnny and Ponyboy not to pick up his bad habits. What does he mean by\r\n            this? Is it a little late, now, to be telling the two boys this? Why or why not?<br/>\r\n            13. Where do they go in Buck’s car?<br/>\r\n            14.
