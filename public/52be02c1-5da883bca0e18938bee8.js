At the start of his journey, when Santiago asks a gypsy woman to interpret his dream about a treasure in the Egyptian pyramids, she asks for one tenth of the treasure in return. When Santiago asks the old man to show him the path to the treasure, the old man requests one tenth of his flock as "payment." Both payments represent a different price we have to pay to fulfill a dream; however, only one will yield a true result. Which payment represents false hope? Can you think of examples from your own life when you had to give up something to meet a goal and found the price too high? ',n.a.createElement("br",null),'2. Paulo Coelho once said that alchemy is all about pursuing our spiritual quest in the physical world as it was given to us. It is the art of transmuting the reality into something sacred, of mixing the sacred and the profane. With this in mind, can you define your Personal Legend? At what time in your life were you first able to act on it? What was your "beginner\'s luck"? Did anything prevent you from following it to conclusion? Having read The Alchemist, do you know what inner resources you need to continue the journey? ',n.a.createElement("br",null),"3. One of the first major diversions from Santiago's journey was the theft of his money in Tangiers, which forced him into taking a menial job with the crystal merchant.

The Englishman, whom Santiago meets when he joins the caravan to the Egyptian pyramids, is searching for \"a universal language, understood by everybody.\" What is that language?

How did the Englishman and Santiago feel about each other? ",n.a.createElement("br",null),'6. The alchemist tells Santiago "you don\'t have to understand the desert: all you have to do is contemplate a simple grain of sand, and you will see in it all the marvels of creation." With this in mind, why do you think the alchemist chose to befriend Santiago, though he knew that the Englishman was the one looking for him? What is the meaning of two dead hawks and the falcon in the oasis? At one point the alchemist explains to Santiago the secret of successfully turning metal into gold. How does this process compare to finding a Personal Legend? ',n.a.createElement("br",null),"7. At the very end of the journey, why did the alchemist leave Santiago alone to complete it?

The alchemist (in the form of Melchizedek) says to Santiago, "When you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true."

The old man states that the "world\'s greatest lie….is that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what\'s happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate."
